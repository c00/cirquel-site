Cirquel Privacy Policy
======================

Data we collect - Personal Information

By "Personal information" we mean: your email address, your name, your displayname and 
your profile image.

If you create an account, we will ask you for your email address and a display name. You 
may choose to complete your profile with a first name, last name and a profile picture. 

Your display name and profile picture will be public. All other information is private. 
Your email address will be used to send you important account related messages such as 
password reset links. 

Data we collect - Your contributions

By "contributions" we mean: Pictures, videos and descriptions you have added to the 
database.

When you add tricks or poses to the app, the images, videos and description will be 
publicly accessible to other users of the app. You can request to have your own images taken 
down. By default, if you delete your account, your contributions will stay online, but the 
link to your account will be removed.

How we use your personal data

We don't. Currently there's no analytics being done, no usage statistics being taken other 
than the default statistics the Google Play store and Apple app store track. Your personal 
info never leaves our servers, and no 3rd party has access to it. If this ever changes, we 
will ask you to opt-in. We will never share your personal information without your 
explicit consent.

Marketing emails and newsletters

We currently don't have a newsletter or any type of marketing email that we send our users. 
If this ever changes, we will ask you to opt-in. We will never send you any marketing emails 
without your prior explicit consent.

Data security

No one outside of the admins have access to the database. Passwords are salted and hashed 
according to modern standards. All connections to our servers are encrypted. 

Data removal

If you want to be 'forgotten', please send an email to privacy@cirquelapp.com. We will 
delete your account and all personal information we have of you. By default we will keep 
your contributions, but will remove the link to your account. If you wish for your 
contributions to be deleted as well, please state that specifically in the email.
